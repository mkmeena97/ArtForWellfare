We are interested in sculpture, photographs and works on canvas, paper or board, including all mediums ,pastel, oil and acrylic, and all sizes.
The preferred subject matter is landscape or still life. We tend to prefer representational works, but pieces in more abstract styles can often work well.
The artworks should be accessible and engaging and offer a sense of hope, joy and healing and motivate individual customers and their families .
The artworks must have a clear and documented provenance.
