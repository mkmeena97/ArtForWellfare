Functional Requirements:
Registered and authorized NGOs working for the benefit of underprivileged individuals suffering from severe diseases. These NGOs require patients to register themselves and provide all relevant treatment files, bills, and doctor's letters to verify their need for financialhelp. The NGOs carefully examine the backgrounds of these patients and review the provided documents with the help of their own doctors and team members to ensure that the patients are genuinely in need of support.

To facilitate the fundraising process, the NGOs have registered themselves on the "Art For Welfare" portal. On this platform, artists who want to contribute to the cause can showcase their artwork. Instead of directly donating funds, artists can present their art pieces on the website, allowing visitors, art collectors, and potential buyers to show their interest in the artwork by making a purchase.

This approach serves a dual purpose. Firstly, it promotes the beauty of art by providing a platform for artists to display their work and connect with potential buyers. Secondly, it supports a noble cause by generating funds through the sale of the artwork. The proceeds from the art sales are then used by the NGOs to provide financial assistance for the medical treatment and support of the registered patients who are genuinely in need.

By combining the power of art with the goal of helping underprivileged individuals with severe diseases, this initiative creates a win-win situation. It encourages artists to contribute their talents while providing a means for individuals interested in art to support a worthy cause.
